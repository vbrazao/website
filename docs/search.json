    "text": "I’m Vasco Brazão, an independent applied statistician based in Lisbon, Portugal. My formal background is in psychology: a MSc in Psychology in Business and Economics from Universidade Católica Portuguesa and a BA in Integrated Social and Cognitive Psychology from Constructor University (formerly Jacobs University Bremen). Since 2018, I’ve strived to learn and apply open science principles to my work, gaining proficiency in the R programming language, delving into Bayesian statistics and causal inference, and most recently, working through a fantastic online book on how to build reproducible analytical pipelines with R.\nYou can find me on BlueSky, where I post a mix of personal and professional content, and on LinkedIn, where I do my best not to post anything at all. Every so often I get obsessed about a new topic and birth a little treatise or blurt out an insight in the form of a blog post which may or may not interest you."

    "text": "Most recently, I’ve been working with a sociologist on analyses related to intimate partner violence, seeking to apply an intersectional lens to understanding how race and gender interact to predict this phenomenon. This work has not been published yet, but I’ve written up a post documenting some specific challenges I found during analyses and how I resolved them which can give you a glimpse into my technical and problem-solving skills.\nAt CLOO - Behavioral Insights Unit, in 2021, I was part of the core team working to reduce food waste at the worker canteens of BRF — a Brazillian food processing company and one of the largest such companies in the world. Our interventions reduced daily food waste by an average of 24% at three sites. To achieve this, we conducted diagnostics in loco, developed behavioral interventions, measured our impact against control canteens, and ensured our interventions did not negatively impact the workers by running surveys before and after the implementation, always working closely with the team at BRF. My role involved developing the methodological strategy, defining and coordinating the measurement strategy, delivering weekly reports to the BRF team on our ongoing measurements, conducting exploratory and inferential analyses of the daily food waste data as well as the survey data, and drafting parts of the final report and presentation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more about this project at the BRF Hub Blog (page in Portuguese — use an automatic translator if required; archived link).\n\n\n\nAt CLOO - Behavioral Insights Unit, in 2020/2021, I led our work supporting the SUSTAINMEALS project. Coordinated by João Graça, PhD, the project sought to increase knowledge and generate evidence with the ultimate goal of facilitating a large-scale shift towards healthier and more sustainable plant-based meals throughout Portugal. I was responsible for leading CLOO’s team within the project, focusing on three key outputs:\n\nWe helped to improve a behavioral change Toolkit that documented and explained 27 behavioral change techniques that can be used to increase consumers’ adoption of healthier or more sustainable meal choices in collective meal contexts and included an implementation guide and corresponding worksheets as well as a diagnostic to facilitate the independent application of these techniques by relevant stakeholders. Our team worked closely with the SUSTAINMEALS team on all aspects of the toolkit, but our biggest contribution may have been finding and explaining concrete, published examples of each behavioral change technique in order to bring readers closer to the research base for the toolkit and illustrate each technique so readers may better understand and eventually apply it.\nI contributed towards a systematic scoping review published in Appetite that “aimed to map determinants of dietary change in collective meal contexts across multiple settings, interventions, target groups, and target behaviors.” While most of the work was carried out by the project team, I earned authorship credit by helping to develop a scoring system for open science indicators and conducting the data extraction for those indicators, drafting the relevant sections of the manuscript, and reviewing the manuscript as it approached its final version.\nMy most challenging contribution was leading the methodological work, technical implementation, and statistical analysis of a field experiment published in Public Health Nutrition. Together with a team from CLOO and SUSTAINMEALS, we developed an intervention to increase the proportion of plant-based meals sold at a university canteen in the Lisbon area. This required coordinating with our partners at the university, from the highest levels of management to the canteen workers who helped us improve menu descriptions and ensure that the data we required was adequately recorded. We did our best to follow open science practices and placed all code and materials in a public online repository.\n\n\nAt CLOO - Behavioral Insights unit in 2019/2020, I led the methodological and analysis tasks of a project for the first time. We supported Eedi, an EdTech company who develop a formative assessment educational app used in schools throughout the United Kingdom, to test the impact of granting parents access to the app on pupils’ educational and app-related outcomes. This work, supported by Nesta’s Solving Together Fund, involved designing and conducting a cluster-randomized trial to test the parent roll-out in 79 Year 7 and 8 classes in 9 schools. While our intervention did not produce the intended outcomes, the process was a rich learning experience for myself and for Eedi — for example, my exploratory data analysis made it clear to the Eedi team that pupil outcomes were much more dependent of the teacher rather than the parents or even app features, as we showed that certain teachers managed to produce high levels of engagement with the app regardless of which year they thoughts, whereas others seemed to always display poor engagement. Besides working to develop the interventions and describing research that would increase Eedi’s knowledge of how to generate positive engagement with their products, my biggest learning experience was enabled by the design of the study itself: clustered data for educational interventions need to be analyzed with a statistical model that adequately accounts for the clustering. I had the chance to autonomously learn about, apply, and interpret multi-level generalized linear models, and have kept refining my skills in this area ever since.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo learn more about this work, read the final report we submitted as the final milestone for the Solving Together Fund."
