    "text": "I’m Vasco Brazão, an independent applied statistician based in Lisbon, Portugal. My formal background is in psychology: a MSc in Psychology in Business and Economics from Universidade Católica Portuguesa and a BA in Integrated Social and Cognitive Psychology from Constructor University (formerly Jacobs University Bremen). Since 2018, I’ve strived to learn and apply open science principles to my work, gaining proficiency in the R programming language, delving into Bayesian statistics and causal inference, and most recently, working through a fantastic online book on how to build reproducible analytical pipelines with R.\nYou can find me on BlueSky, where I post a mix of personal and professional content, and on LinkedIn, where I do my best not to post anything at all. Every so often I get obsessed about a new topic and birth a little treatise or blurt out an insight the form of a blog post which may or may not interest you."
