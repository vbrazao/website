I'm Vasco Brazão, an independent applied statistician based in Lisbon, Portugal. My formal background is in psychology: a MSc in Psychology in Business and Economics from [Universidade Católica Portuguesa](https://www.ucp.pt/?set_language=en) and a BA in Integrated Social and Cognitive Psychology from [Constructor University](https://constructor.university/) (formerly Jacobs University Bremen). Since 2018, I've strived to learn and apply open science principles to my work, gaining proficiency in the R programming language, delving into Bayesian statistics and causal inference, and most recently, working through a fantastic online book on [how to build reproducible analytical pipelines with R](https://raps-with-r.dev/).

You can find me on [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/vascobrazao.bsky.social), where I post a mix of personal and professional content, and on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vascobrazao/), where I do my best not to post anything at all. Every so often I get obsessed about a new topic and birth a little treatise or blurt out an insight in the form of a [blog](https://vbrazao.github.io/blog/) post which may or may not interest you.
